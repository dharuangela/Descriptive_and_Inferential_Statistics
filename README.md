# 📊 Descriptive and Inferential Statistics – Mini Project

This project is designed to help students gain a strong foundation in both **Descriptive** and **Inferential Statistics** through a hands-on, step-by-step approach. All exercises are solved using Python in a Google Colab notebook with explanations and formulas.

## 📚 Project Objectives

- Understand key statistical concepts and definitions.
- Compute measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode).
- Calculate dispersion (range, variance, standard deviation).
- Interpret confidence intervals.
- Perform hypothesis testing using real-world examples.
